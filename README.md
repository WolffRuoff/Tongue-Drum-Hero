1. launch Lens Studio
2. Select "Open Project" and choose "Tongue Drum Hero.lsproj" in the root directory of this repo.
3. In the upper-right-hand corner of the project, there should be a button to send the project to Snapchat. Click the arrow next to it and select "Send to Spectacles"

## How to Setup the Tongue Drum Hero Tracker
The Tongue Drum Hero demonstration of the HeARo framework is currently only compatible to the "Yinama Steel Tongue Drum Percussion Instrument 11 Notes 10 inches" that can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QF5FB12). Please make sure to purchase the 10 inch version and not the 12 inch. 

Once you have the Tongue Drum, the next step is to print the [marker](./Public/Markers/Scaled_Marker_Image.png) onto an 8.5x11in piece of paper in landscape. From there, you can mount the marker to the back of the tongue drum via popsicle sticks and tape or any other apparatus you see fit. Once mounted, then adjust the marker so that the notes line up. Alternatively, once mounted you can adjust the position of notes (Camera/Image Marker/Notes) scene object in the scene.


## Missing Features
There are many ways in which the HeARo framework can be further developed. One such way would be adding sound input to the framework. By taking in sound, HeARo could recognize the notes being played on an instrument. This would allow HeARo to judge how well users are playing and give them ways to measure their improvement over time via a leaderboard system. Another improvement would be implementing 3D instrument models by setting up an instrument mesh in the scene. This would allow HeARo to work with instruments that are played outside of the userâ€™s field of view. One more potential future improvement for HeARo would be adding more gamification elements. For example, adding functionality that makes the green spheres fly towards the right note could make HeARo more fun to use while increasing engagement with users.


## Current Bugs
There are currently only two known bugs in Tongue Drum Hero that are both results of Lens Studio and the Spectacles. The first one is that when you move your head quickly as the marker is first discovered the notes will be significantly off. This is because the extended marker tracking only uses the first frame of the marker tracking while the marker tracking itself requires multiple frames to calibrate itself if the glasses are quickly moving. The second bug is that the extended marker tracking sometimes causes the notes to drift overtime. Both of these bugs can be fixed by simply restarting the lens.

## Asset Sources
I made all of the assets in this project except for the magnifying glass hint icon which way made by Snap Inc.
