## How to Setup the Tongue Drum Hero Tracker
The Tongue Drum Hero demonstration of the HeARo framework is currently only compatible to the "Yinama Steel Tongue Drum Percussion Instrument 11 Notes 10 inches" that can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QF5FB12). Please make sure to purchase the 10 inch version and not the 12 inch. 

Once you have the Tongue Drum, the next step is to print the [marker](./Public/Markers/Scaled_Marker_Image.png) onto an 8.5x11in piece of paper in landscape. From there, you can mount the marker to the back of the tongue drum via popsicle sticks and tape or any other apparatus you see fit. Once mounted, then adjust the marker so that the notes line up. Alternatively, once mounted you can adjust the position of notes (Camera/Image Marker/Notes) scene object in the scene.


## Missing Features
## Current Bugs
There are currently only two bugs in Tongue Drum Hero that are both results of Lens Studio and the Spectacles. The first one is that when you move your head quickly as the marker is first discovered the notes will be significantly off. The second bug is that the extended marker tracking sometimes causes the notes to drift overtime. Both of these bugs can be fixed by simply restarting the lens.
